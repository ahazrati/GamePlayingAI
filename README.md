![Example game of isolation](viz.gif)

♣	Built an Artificial Intelligence that beats human opponents in the game of Isolation, written in Python
♣	Implemented the AI with Minimax Algorithm, Alpha-Beta Pruning and Iterative Deepening algorithms
♣	Created 3 custom score functions optimizing the heuristic evaluation of a given game state   
♣	Used caching and memoization to reduce the search space significantly by recognizing patterns like symmetry
